# Project Brief: Snowpark vs Postgres POC

## Project Overview
This is a proof-of-concept project designed to benchmark and compare performance between Snowflake's Snowpark and PostgreSQL databases. The project aims to provide empirical data and insights into the performance characteristics of both systems under various conditions.

## Core Requirements
1. Performance Benchmarking
   - Execute identical queries on both Snowflake and PostgreSQL
   - Measure and compare query execution times
   - Generate consistent test data for both systems
   - Support multiple query types and data volumes

2. Data Generation
   - Create synthetic datasets with configurable sizes
   - Ensure data consistency across both systems
   - Support various data types and relationships

3. Results Analysis
   - Collect detailed performance metrics
   - Generate comparative reports
   - Document findings and insights

## Project Goals
1. Technical Understanding
   - Gain insights into performance characteristics of both systems
   - Identify strengths and limitations of each platform
   - Document best practices for each system

2. Decision Support
   - Provide data-driven insights for technology selection
   - Help understand trade-offs between systems
   - Support architectural decisions

3. Knowledge Transfer
   - Document findings for future reference
   - Share insights with team members
   - Create reusable benchmarking framework

## Success Criteria
1. Accurate and reproducible benchmarks
2. Comprehensive performance metrics
3. Clear comparative analysis
4. Well-documented findings
5. Reusable benchmarking framework
